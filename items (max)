"""

This is the index of all possible items in the game world. Note that These

key-value pairs are more like blueprints than actual items. The actual

items exist in the GROUND value in an area's entry in the world variable.



The GROUNDDESC value is a short string that displays in the area's description.

The SHORTDESC value is a short string that will be used in sentences like, "You

drop X." or "You buy X."

The LONGDESC value is displayed when the player looks at the item.

The TAKEABLE Boolean value is True if the player can pick up the item and put

it in their inventory.

The DESCWORDS value is a list of strings that can be used in the player's

commands. For example, if this is ['welcome', 'sign'] then the player can type

a command such as "take sign" or "look welcome".

The TAKEABLE value is True if the item can be picked up off the ground. If

this key doesn't exist, it defaults to True.

The EDIBLE value is True if the item can be eaten. If this key doesn't exist,

it defaults to False.
